```{r}
library(tidyverse)
df <- read.csv("asdf.csv")

df <- df %>%
  filter(!is.na(grade_span),
         grade_span == "09-12") 
#reshape(df, idvar = "school_name", timevar = "subgroup", direction = "wide")

slhs <- df %>%
  filter(school_name == "Southern Lee High School",
         subject == "ACT") 


slhs
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
