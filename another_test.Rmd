```{r}
library(tidyverse)
df <- read.csv("asdf.csv")

df_1 <- df %>%
  filter(!is.na(grade_span),
         grade_span == "09-12") %>%
  select(school_code, school_name, sbe_region, title_1, missed_days, subgroup, subject, den, total_pct, grade_span)

df_2 <- reshape(df_1, idvar = "school_name", timevar = "subgroup", direction = "wide")

df_2

df_2$sbe

colnames(df_2)
colnames(df)

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
